Got back to Amsterdam after a couple of years with a couple of friends. We stayed away from most of the touristy places.

> [Shashwat Joshi](https://in.linkedin.com/in/shashwat-joshi-ba5071ba) and [Manan Tomar](https://manantomar.github.io/) joined me on this trip.

Discovered [Foodhallen](https://foodhallen.nl/amsterdam), which was a very chill place with good food and good music, and best of all, no tourists!
