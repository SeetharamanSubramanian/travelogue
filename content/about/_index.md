I am an enthusiastic product designer, and desire to envision and develop great products that have a global impact. I am currently studying MA/MSc in Global Innovation Design at the Royal College of Art and Imperial College London. I have completed my undergraduate studies in Engineering Design from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. I hail from the city of Jamshedpur in Jharkhand, and am fluent in English, Hindi and Tamil.

My interests include reading fantasy books, watching anime and competing with my friends on the Fantasy Premier League.
