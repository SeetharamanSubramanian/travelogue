Christmas in Paris was just magical.

> Note to self, always check the public transport situation in Paris. Planned industrial action can ruin your own plans.

It was an adventure into itself each day to reach our hotel, which was unfortunately in Zone 5 near the airport.

The Christmas market in front of the [Grande Arche](https://www.parisdigest.com/monument/la-grande-arche.htm) was magical.

The actual Christmas morning was deserted, which was to be expected.

Ended the trip with a visit to the [Sacre Coeur Basilica](http://www.sacre-coeur-montmartre.com/english/history-and-visit/), from where the views of the city were breathtaking.
